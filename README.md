This week, we're building a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

## <a name="Task">The Task</a>

We're going to build a bookmark manager. A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

## <a name="Installation">Installation Instructions</a>

Clone the repository from github then change directory into it. Run bundle then rackup to initialise the server.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:BenSheridanEdwards/Bookmark_Manager.git
$ cd Bookmark_Manager
$ bundle
$ rackup
```

## <a name="Story">User Stories</a>

```
As a user of the bookmark manager,
I want to view my bookmarks,
so it should show a list of my bookmarks. 
```
